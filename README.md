[01:10.07] Let's light it up, let's light it up
[01:11.37] Until our hearts catch fire
[01:15.97] And so the world, a burning light
[01:18.94] They've never shined so bright
[01:33.94] 
[01:23.81] We'll find a way, we'll find a way
[01:26.73] To keep the cold night
[01:28.41] From breaking in over the walls
[01:30.52] Into the wild side, the hunger satisfied
[01:50.52] 
[01:39.34] We're burning up,
[01:43.25] We might as well be lovers on the Sun
[01:49.65] We might as well be lovers on the Sun
[01:58.72] We might as well be lovers on the Sun
[02:17.22] 
[02:06.47] We'll never know, we'll never know
[02:55.19] What stands behind the North
[03:00.67] But I got a feeling
[03:02.19] It's a feeling that's we're dying for
[03:07.88] Just close your eyes, and hold your breath
[04:59.66] Because it feels right
[05:00.49] We'll keep it moving till we make it to the other side,
[05:01.45] and let's enjoy the ride!
[05:02.23] We're burning up,
[05:02.93] We might as well be lovers on the Sun
[05:03.68] We might as well be lovers on the Sun
[05:04.28] We might as well be lovers on the Sun
[05:22.78] 
[05:04.94] Let's light it up, let's light it up
[05:05.57] Until our hearts catch fire
[05:06.25] And so the world, a burning light
[05:06.84] They've never shined so bright
